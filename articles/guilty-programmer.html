        <h1>GUILTY programmer</h1>
        <p>In my opinion, every programmer that has at least a few years of coding experience should know how to write clean code. However, just knowing how to write clean code doesn't mean that it will be applied consistently.</p>
        <p>But what's the reason? If you know how to write clean code, why aren't you doing it?</p>
        <p>There can be various reasons. In this article I will attempt to address some of the justifications that I encountered during my practice.</p>

        <h2>JUST MOVED TO THIS TEAM</h2>
        <img alt="" src="/images/gp-2.webp">
        <p>Being new in the team and unfamiliar with the project can make a programmer feel <span class="bold">unconfident</span>. The programmer can identify obvious <span class="bold">issues in the code</span> but refrain from fixing or raising them due to feeling unconfident in the new team and project. As a result, new lines of code are added to already poor quality code, <span class="bold">exacerbating the problem</span>.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that this behavior does not apply to everyone, as it largely depends on an <span class="bold">individual's character</span>.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, there are also types of programmers who, upon joining a team, immediately start making appropriate and <span class="bold">inappropriate criticisms</span> of the code, starting from day one.</p>

        <h2>WON'T TOUCH WHILE WORKS</h2>
        <img alt="" src="/images/gp-3.webp">
        <p>It's not uncommon for programmers to have to work on parts of <span class="bold">legacy code</span>, where the inner workings are unknown or unclear and there is nobody available to explain it.</p>
        <p>Although it's obvious that the code needs to be improved, programmers usually don't do that because they are afraid that changes will <span class="bold">affect other parts</span> of the program and will break the whole application.</p>
        <p>In this case, it would not be fair to criticize the programmers as their <span class="bold">concerns</span> may be <span class="bold">valid</span>.</p>
        <p>Decision about improving the code or leaving as it is (or even making it worse) may depend on various factors.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Knowledge:</span> Often, legacy code utilizes old technologies, languages, and libraries. To improve such code, a complete understanding of it is necessary, and mastering those old technologies is required to understand it.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Deadline:</span> Does the programmer have enough time to improve the code ?</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Testing:</span> Will enough resources be provided for regression tests?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>THE LAST WEEK</h2>
        <img alt="" src="/images/gp-4.webp">
        <p>Based on my experience of switching several companies, I can confidently say that during the last working days, there is a <span class="bold">lack of motivation</span> to do anything related to the work.</p>
        <p>However, this does not justify poor quality code being written by programmers during the rest of their days in that company, just because they have submitted an <span class="bold">application</span> for <span class="bold">dismissal</span>.</p>
        <p>Firstly, it is <span class="bold">disrespectful</span> to their <span class="bold">teammates</span>, as they will have to fix all the issues caused by the poor quality code.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, in general, it shows a lack of professionalism and basic human decency of that person.</p>

        <h2>NO CODE REVIEWS</h2>
        <img alt="" src="/images/gp-5.webp">
        <p>There are cases when the team does not conduct code reviews at all, and everyone writes their code in their <span class="bold">preferred way</span>.</p>
        <p>As a result, the quality of the code relies entirely on the conscience of the programmers, and as experience shows, <span class="bold">not all</span> team members possess a strong sense of responsibility. Most of them don't spend a little more time to write clean code, instead they think "Well, the important thing is that it works, there is no desire to write so thoroughly."</p>

        <h2>OVERCONFIDENCE</h2>
        <img alt="" src="/images/gp-6.webp">
        <p>The quality of the code also depends on one more factor.</p>
        <p>There are programmers that overestimate their experience and knowledge, resulting in inconsistent code compared to their teammates.</p>
        <p>It can be expressed in different ways.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>creating a <span class="bold">new method</span> instead of using existing one</li>
            <li>integrating a <span class="bold">new library</span> instead of using already integrated alternative</li>
            <li><span class="bold">not</span> following common <span class="bold">rules</span> (naming convention, files structure etc.)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>I'M BEING RUSHED</h2>
        <img alt="" src="/images/gp-7.webp">
        <p>There are cases when programmers want to write a clean code but they cannot do that because they are being <span class="bold">rushed</span>. As a result they have to find quick and bad solutions.</p>
        <p>From a business perspective, the implementation of <span class="bold">suboptimal solutions</span> may be seen as acceptable, however, from a technical standpoint, it can lead to complications in resolving future issues and may even make them <span class="bold">impossible</span> to fix.</p>

        <h2>VARIABILITY</h2>
        <img alt="" src="/images/gp-8.webp">
        <p>Frequent change requests from the business team can create chaos in the code.</p>
        <p>Such cases are often observed in startups where not all the requirements are predefined and the <span class="bold">direction</span> of the project may change <span class="bold">rapidly</span>. This can result in programmers having to change already implemented architecture or add new features to existing architecture, which can decrease <span class="bold">code quality</span>, making it harder to maintain and update in the future.</p>

        <h2>AVOIDING CONFLICTS</h2>
        <img alt="" src="/images/gp-9.webp">
        <p>There are teams where all the programmers review the code of their teammates.</p>
        <p>There are teams where experienced programmers review the code of teammates with less experience.</p>
        <p>In both cases, the code reviewers may <span class="bold">feel reluctant</span> to raise issues or conflicts with the person who wrote the code.</p>
        <p>Reviewers may overlook some obvious flaws, thinking that the author of the code may be <span class="bold">upset</span> or may harbor negative feelings towards them, if they bring up issues.</p>
        <p>that's it...</p>
