            <span class="dialogue-1">- What does a developer have to do with a warrior?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- I will explain later, now we need to leave this place as soon as possible.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- You don’t have to leave here to speak. Nothing prevents you from answering my questions now.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- I say we must get out of here quickly before it reaches us.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Who is reaching us?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- Garbage collector.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Who is that ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- He will destroy us if we meet him.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Why ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- Because we don’t need anyone at this time.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- How come we do not need anyone ? We just did a lot of important work, all the data of application inside of us.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- You are right. However, there is a bug in the application, we have been declared in an incorrect scope and soon everything declared in that scope will be destroyed.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Hmm.. Who is to blame ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- Nobody.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- How is it possible ? if no one created him, he would not exist.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- Developers create everything. They create us intentionally and bugs accidentally.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Well, it turns out the developers are to blame.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- No. They do it without any intention, no need to blame them.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Well, do we have a plan about getting out of here ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- The only thing I rely on is the professionalism of our developer.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- How can it be helpful ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- I have known him for a long time. I remember how he included me in the first release. He is a good developer, he does everything quite thoughtfully. As I said before, all the programs have bugs but our developer usually takes into account all the worst cases and prepares solutions for them. As he created you recently, in the last release, probably you didn’t notice that yet. But I’m sure you will notice it as well soon.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- You gave me a little hope…</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- Look there ! Do you see those lights ? Let’s go there, it’s possible we can find some friends there that can save us from the garbage collector.</span>

        <h2>HEAP. Pay for tools you use</h2>
        <p class="dialogue">
            <span class="dialogue-1">- While we are on the way, can you tell me about our developer ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- What do you want to know about him ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- You often say that he is a warrior. Why do you say that ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- I say he is a warrior because he fights against a lot of enemies every day. He is organized, disciplined, productive, observant and kind. And most importantly, he knows his profession very well. It is typical for warriors to have their own rules, which they never break. Our developer has such rules.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Can you tell me what those rules are ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- I can’t recall all of them, but I’ll tell you about some. So one of the rules is that he always pays for tools he uses, he never uses cracked programs. Of course that rule cannot be applied to free tools.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Why does he pay for something if he can get it for free ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- The world where our developer lives, nothing is free. All the things that seem free have a hidden cost that is not visible at first glance.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Does it mean that even if he would have used cracked programs he would still pay for them in some way?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- Exactly.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- I see. I think that is a true mindset for a warrior.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- Here we are. Everything you see here are various variables. It’s the heap of the application. Here always new variables are appearing and then being deleted.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- What do you think will we find friends here ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- Seems no. As I can see everyone here has its owner and nobody needs us. Let’s go, we will try to find salvation in the stack.</span>
        </p>
        <img alt="" src="/images/wc-3.webp">

            <h2>STACK. Productivity time</h2>
        <p class="dialogue">
            <span class="dialogue-1">- What about time management, is there any rule about it ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- Sure there is. And that is one of the most important rules.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Tell me about that rule.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- We need to find a safe place before that.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Maybe we can enter the stack ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- That’s a good idea. Look there, do you see all those coming here ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Yes.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- Soon they will enter the stack as well.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Is that good or bad ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- If we can make friends with at least one of them, it will be possible to escape from the garbage collector.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Let’s enter then.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- Ok, let’s enter and wait for them in the stack.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Seems it’s a safe place.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- I think so. Regarding time management he has some rules. Right now I can recall only one of them.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- And what does that rule say ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- Our developer divides the workday into periods of high to medium productivity.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Can you give me a detailed explanation ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- He is a human being, and people have a tendency to get tired and bored. And in such cases they usually listen to their favorite music during work, which to some extent relieves fatigue and boredom. However, in many cases, all this is abused . Many people start listening to music during work regardless of whether they have just started or are already finishing, are they tired or fresh, is the work interesting or boring..</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- And what does our developer do in such cases ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- He has a rule according to which it is forbidden to listen to music in the morning or to be distracted by other things than work. He calls that period of time “high productivity period” — it lasts about three hours. During those few hours, he usually does 60% of the day’s work and the other 40% during the “average productivity period”. In the latter period he can listen to music or anything that interests him during work.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- I wonder if he always follows that rule?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- People are not like us, they do not follow specific instructions. Even if he sets certain rules for himself, he has to break them from time to time. But mainly by observing those rules, he remains quite productive.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Here come our future friends.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- Oh no, just not that.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- What happened ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- They all are callbacks.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Does that prevent us from befriending them?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- No, but making friends with them will not save us, because their lives are very short.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- What can we do ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- We have to wait until they get out of here, so we can get out too.</span>
            <img alt="" src="/images/wc-4.webp">
        </p>

        <h2>EVENT LOOP. Create helper scripts</h2>
        <p class="dialogue">
            <span class="dialogue-1">- I never waited in a queue so long. We finally got out.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- In a sense, it was good that we got out of the stack later, we were able to get around the garbage collector.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Where are we going now?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- I think we can find shelter in the event loop for some time.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Is that the place where everyone is waiting for their finest hour?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- Exactly. Everyone goes there and waits for his execution time.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- I wonder if the garbage collector can find us there ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- Let’s go ! It should be safe there, I think.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- What other interesting rules does our developer have?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- He creates helpers for himself.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- How does he do that ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- At work, there are certain tasks that developers repeat dozens of times every day.
            For example, filling in some forms, creating various files, making some calculations, etc. It is almost always possible to automate all those tasks. Thus, our developer creates small utility programs, which simplify his work and save a lot of time.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- Interesting .. But I think it takes a lot of time to create those helpers։</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- He does it during work, as soon as he has free time. As the number of helpers increases, so does the amount of free time he’s able to devote to creating other helpers.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- What is this ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2" style="background-color: #ec9f9f">- An error has been raised. Hold on tight ! it will throw us out now !</span>
        </p>
        <img alt="" src="/images/wc-5.webp">

        <h2>ERROR HANDLER. Always have things to do</h2>
        <p class="dialogue">
            <span class="dialogue-1">- Where are we?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- Seems I was right..</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- What do you mean ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- I mean the professionalism of our developer. We are now in the error handler. We were just thrown out of the event-loop, fortunately our developer had planned this case. If you remember, I was saying that he is my hope. So I’m convinced one more time that it is worth relying on him.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- It seems he really thought carefully about all the cases. Only if he does not get bored and starts to do everything badly ..</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- He will not ! He has a rule for that as well.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- What rule is that ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- Boredom for developers is mainly caused by idleness and waiting. He tries never to be idle, thus avoiding boredom.</span>

            <span class="dialogue-1">- What does he do when there is nothing to do ?</span>

            <span class="dialogue-2">- Writes helper scripts, reads books, writes articles, etc. He always has things to do, whether there are assigned tasks to him or not.</span>
