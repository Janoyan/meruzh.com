        <h1>Programming Prolongs Life</h1>
        <p class="quote">Creative people live longer and sometimes even forever</p>
        <p>This is due to the fact that according to some sources when people create, they transfer a small part of themselves to their works. </p>
        <p>For instance, a small part of the artist lives in his paintings, some part of the writer lives in his books, there is a certain part of the singer in his songs, etc. </p>
        <p>And the most interesting thing is that after the physical death of the creators, their works continue to live by making alive their creators as well.</p>
        <p>As you already guessed, programming also allows you to do all those things and even more.</p>
        <p class="quote">Programmer's job is to “create” </p>
        <p>Programmers also create and probably more than others. This is because that the programmer's job is to “create”. Let's compare the jobs of an artist and a programmer. There are lots of cases when artists have to do work other than painting to make money and painting only in their spare time. Meanwhile, programmers have the opportunity to “create” and earn money while doing the same work.</p>
        <p class="quote">Programmer's work does live for real</p>
        <p>Programs that write programmers have an important singularity, they do live for real. You run your code, and it starts to live, talk to people, solve people's problems, answer their questions, provide the necessary information, and all of these it does with millions of people simultaneously. Even a person with the most supernatural qualities known to mankind doesn’t have such abilities. </p>
        <img alt="" src="/images/pp2.gif">
        <p class="quote">Programmers create “creatures” endowed with divine abilities</p>
        <p>It can be assumed that programmers not only create but also create “creatures” endowed with divine abilities, with which people get in touch almost everywhere and every second.</p>
        <p class="quote">Who likes his job creates more</p>
        <p>As everywhere in programming also there are people who like their job and there are ones who do their job just for the sake of earning money. Actually, both of them create but who likes his job creates more. </p>
        <p class="quote">By doing your job well you prolong your life</p>
        <p>Please remember that by doing your job well you create things, you change the world, you prolong your life. So next time when you write code just remember that it’s part of you and remember that it will start to live right after the first deployment. </p>
        <p>Now let’s create a very, very small “creature” who is going to do compliments to humanity. </p>
        <p>Below you see a small code snippet written in javascript. As I already said, after deployment, a code starts to live. I have deployed it, it lives now.</p>
        <p>Each time when people click to the green button bellow part of me will do them a compliment even after my death ☠️.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
  var button = document.querySelector('button');

  button.addEventListener('click', function() {
        document.querySelector('#container').innerHTML = '*****';
  });
</code></pre>


        <button onclick="showMessage()" id="god">GREEN BUTTON</button>
